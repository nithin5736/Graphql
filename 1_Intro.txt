Graphql is a query language.
Graphql exists as a layer between frontend and backend.
Client uses this query language to request data from an api,the graphql takes that 
request into consideration and returns that specific data.

There are generally two types of requests in graphql.
    i. query --> same as GET method basically means retrieve data
   ii. mutation --> same as POST,DELETE,PUT,PATCH methods basically means performing
                    some operation with data

Main difference between Graphql and REST is
  i. Graphql has only one end point which is easy to remember
      /users ------
                   \
      /posts -----------> /graphql
                   /
      /comments----

  ii. Overfetching and Underfetching

Suppose if a client needs to display the followers of each user(entity which has name,followers,...)
then he can do in two ways
Overfetching --> 
he retrieves that whole data of each user from database and displays the number of followers.
So,he is fetching more data than he actually wants to display
Underfetching --> 
generally user creates specfic end points like /followers,/posts,/comments,etc to retrieve
the followers,posts,comments of each user.So,here user is creating multiple end points with
rest api.

But Graphql helps to query specfic data what user requires from database. Overfetching and
Underfetching does not happen with Graphql.
