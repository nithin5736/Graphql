Every Graphql api has a root type called Query consists of list of 
queries that can be made.

type Query {
    users: [User]
    user(id : ID!): User
}


Suppose if you want to identify a user based on id and name then

type Query {
    users: [User]
    user(id: ID!, name: String!): User
}

(or)

input UserInput {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}

type Query {
    users: [User]
    user(filter: UserInput): User
}
